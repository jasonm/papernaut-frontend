	Abstract = {Deinococcus radiodurans, a gram positive bacterium whose ability to
 survive extremely high damage to its DNA which is for example induced by
 genotoxic chemicals, ionizing radiation, UV radiation or desiccation is
 still not completely understood. Because of its radiation and desiccation resistance, this extremophile is a prime candidate for possibly surviving environmental conditions as they occur on Mars and during a hypothetical interplanetary space travel. So far just minor work has been done on the damaging effects of UV radiation, especially
 polychromatic UV radiation in the UVB and UVA range, and
 desiccation/vacuum exposure, which is known to induce DNA damages
 similar to radiation. Therefore, we started to further investigate the radiation resistance and the repair mechanisms of Deinococcus radiodurans, concentrating on the effect of polychromatic UV radiation
 and desiccation in the wild type strain and ionizing radiation and UV radiation sensitive mutants. The results of this ongoing project will be of great interest to questions concerning planetary protection, spacecraft disinfecting measures and the search for life on other earth-like planets in general.},
