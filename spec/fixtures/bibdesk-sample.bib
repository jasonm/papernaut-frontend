@incollection{panikov_microbial_2009,
	Abstract = {This chapter is a review on metabolic activity of microorganisms in permafrost and frozen tundra soils. Several noteworthy
 limitations resulted from critical analysis of available techniques, in particular regarding soil respiration: the apparent CO2 flux from frozen soil was shown to overestimate the actual microbial activity due to abiotic release of CO2 accumulated in the sample. Even acidic non-carbonaceous soils contain a large pool (up to 40% of the total soil C) of bound
 CO2 overlooked by soil chemists. The method of choice seems to be 14CO2 uptake which can be used to detect separately activities of photo-, chemolitho- and chemoorganotrophic microorganisms. Permafrost
 allows gas exchange (D= 6.9 10-9 cm2 sec-1 for 14CO2 at -- 20$\,^{\circ}$C) and contains unfrozen water; these two factors are sufficient to support activity of specialized microorganisms
 in the temperature range 0 to -- 40$\,^{\circ}$C. The preferable growth substrates were shown to be gases and volatiles (ethanol, methane).
 A new cultivation approach based on the use of solid frozen media was developed as a substitute of traditional liquid media with antifreezes. Enrichments were grown on the solid ethanol-microcrystal cellulose powder frozen to -- 8$\,^{\circ}$C. Several organisms
 able to grow in frozen media without antifreezes were isolated from Alaskan permafrost including novel bacterial species (Polaromonas hydrogenovorans, Pseudmonas sp, and Arthrobacter sp.) as well as basidiomycetous yeasts (order Leucosporidiales) and mycelial fungi of the family Stereaceae. The last organisms turned out to be able active down to -- 25$\,^{\circ}$C.},

	Abstract = {Deinococcus radiodurans, a gram positive bacterium whose ability to
 survive extremely high damage to its DNA which is for example induced by
 genotoxic chemicals, ionizing radiation, UV radiation or desiccation is
 still not completely understood. Because of its radiation and desiccation resistance, this extremophile is a prime candidate for possibly surviving environmental conditions as they occur on Mars and during a hypothetical interplanetary space travel. So far just minor work has been done on the damaging effects of UV radiation, especially
 polychromatic UV radiation in the UVB and UVA range, and
 desiccation/vacuum exposure, which is known to induce DNA damages
 similar to radiation. Therefore, we started to further investigate the radiation resistance and the repair mechanisms of Deinococcus radiodurans, concentrating on the effect of polychromatic UV radiation
 and desiccation in the wild type strain and ionizing radiation and UV radiation sensitive mutants. The results of this ongoing project will be of great interest to questions concerning planetary protection, spacecraft disinfecting measures and the search for life on other earth-like planets in general.},

@article{andrianantoandro_synthetic_2006,
	Abstract = {Synthetic biologists engineer complex artificial biological systems to investigate natural biological phenomena and for a variety of applications. We outline the basic features of synthetic biology as a new engineering discipline, covering examples from the latest literature and reflecting on the features that make it unique among all other existing engineering fields. We discuss methods for designing and constructing engineered cells with novel functions in a framework of an abstract hierarchy of biological devices, modules, cells, and multicellular systems. The classical engineering strategies of standardization, decoupling, and abstraction will have to be extended to take into account the inherent characteristics of biological devices and modules. To achieve predictability and reliability, strategies for engineering biology must include the notion of cellular context in the functional definition of devices and modules, use rational redesign and directed evolution for system optimization, and focus on accomplishing tasks using cell populations rather than individual cells. The discussion brings to light issues at the heart of designing complex living systems and provides a trajectory for future development.},
