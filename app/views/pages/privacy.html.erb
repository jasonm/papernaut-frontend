The Big Picture

So far, this is a one-person side-project operation by Jason Morrison.

Papernaut is dedicated to safeguarding your privacy online. The following explains how we will treat information that you may provide to us as you make use of our Site and Services. By accessing our websites (the “Sites”) and accepting the Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”), you consent to our collection, disclosure, storage and use of certain non-personally-identifying information about you as you use our Sites. We may use this data to better understand our users and build a better service. We can also publish this data, but only if the data will portray a large group of users, not individuals.

We may also ask you to provide personal information, but you’ll always be able to opt out of providing such information.

We can also collect information via cookies, but you can choose not to store these. However, choosing to disable cookies may impact your ability to use our services.

That’s the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before you may use any of our services. This Privacy Policy is effective immediately, meaning that every time you visit our Site or use the Services on our Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy may change over time. Such modifications will become effective immediately upon their posting to this page. It is your obligation to review this Privacy Policy on a regular basis to inform yourself of any changes that may have been made. Your continued use of any of our Services denotes your acceptance of any such modified terms.

The Fine Print

Reuse
This document is based upon the Rails Rumble Privacy Policy, which itself is based on the Automattic Privacy Policy, and is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5. Basically, this means that you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit the original authors within the edited version.

Cloud Warmer, Inc. operates the Rails Rumble innovation competition and makes available to users certain services, including our Sites (railsrumble.com), our blog, our API, and any other software, sites, and services offered by Rails Rumble in connection to any of those (taken together, the “Service”). It is Rails Rumble’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Sites.

Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Papernaut collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Papernaut’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Papernaut’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Papernaut may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Papernaut also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Papernaut only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Papernaut’s websites choose to interact with Papernaut in ways that require Papernaut to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Papernaut gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, connecting with Zotero or Mendeley provides your username for those respective services.  In each case, Papernaut collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Papernaut. Papernaut does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Aggregated Statistics
Papernaut may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Papernaut may monitor the most popular papers requested. Papernaut may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Papernaut does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Papernaut discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Papernaut’s behalf or to provide services available at Papernaut’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Papernaut’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Papernaut will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Papernaut discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Papernaut believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Papernaut, third parties or the public at large.  If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Papernaut takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Papernaut uses cookies to help Papernaut identify and track visitors, their usage of Papernaut website, and their website access preferences. Papernaut visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Papernaut’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Papernaut’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Third Party Websites
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information Papernaut collects from you. If you disclose your information to others, such as third party websites that are not affiliated with Papernaut, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of your information. For example, by visiting outbound links to integrated services (such as Zotero or Mendeley) or linked content (such as papers), a third party may receive information such as your IP address. Since Papernaut does not control the privacy policies or conduct of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies and user agreements of those third parties. It is your obligation to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and user agreements of such other websites that you use.

Data Storage
Papernaut uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.

Comments
Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.

Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Papernaut may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Papernaut’s sole discretion. Papernaut encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
